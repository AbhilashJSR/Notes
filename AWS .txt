AWS --> EC2, EBS  --- cost 
Microsoft  -> Vertual machines
Google --> Compute engines

Cloud services:- on-premises, Infrstructure as a services, platform as services, software as services.
In this, we maintain servers and ec2 machines and spin of a server.
-------------------
Regions: AWS region is a saperate geographic area were we cluster data center.

What is Availability zone?
-> Each AWS region is completely indepentdent.
Each AWs region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZ's within a geographic area.

Availability Zone: Green circles define upcoming zones.
Numbers represents the availability zone.

AWS never disclose availablity zones in particular locations.

IAM : Identity and Access Management.
--> is a service provided by AWS that allows you to manage users, groups, and permissions to securely 
	control access to your AWS resources
 How IAM Works:
		-Creating a User:
		-Assigning Permissions:
		-IAM Role for EC2
		-Temporary Access with Roles: IAM roles can be used for temporary access. 
		For example, a user in another AWS account can assume a role to access your resources for a limited time.

Cloud Watch: Cloud watch is a monitoring tool which monitors all those services gather those matrics and keeps it within
			service.
All AWS instances has some metrics.
	-Monitoring of resources.
	-Monitoring of Applications.

Using instance ID we can get matrics details.
	Metrics --> metrics are data about the performance of your systems.
	2 types: 
		Basic Monitoring: Basic monitoring which polls for every 5 min.
		Detailed Monitoring:  ability to collect more frequent and granular metrics for your AWS resources, specifically for services like Amazon EC2 instances.
	
Alarm --> Cloudwatch alarms feature allow us to watch CloudWatch metrics and to recieve notifications when the metrics
		fall outside of the levels that has been configured.
	Ex: if CPU usage goes beyond static threshold alrm goes to alarm state.
 
 3 states in CW alarm:
	-Alarm state
	-Insufficient
	-OK state.

Cloud Trial: AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing 
		of your AWS account. 
		In Cloud trial we can check who deletes or modifies the file.

SNS --> Simple Notification Service

Vid 3:
SNS uses another service called SQS (Simple Queue Service) to store the message in queue format.
Queue  --> Stores  the messages and disperse them for the developers using queue name.
	FIFO Queue  -> First in first out the messages. Order of delivery of messages. and keeps the messages in order.
		Subscription protocol: SQS.
	Standard Queue -->
		Best efforts messaing order.
		At-least once message delivery.
		Highest throughout the publishers/secound.
We can trigger Lambda function using SNS.

Vid 4:
SQS Simple Queue Service:  is a fully managed message queuing service provided by AWS that allows you to decouple 
							and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
Key features of SQS:
	-Visibility Timeout: sets the length of time that a message recieved from queue will not be visible to the other
		other message consumers.
	-Delivery delay:  a specialized implementation of a blocking queue that orders elements based on their delay time.
	-DLQ Dead letter Queue: If a message cant be consumed successfully, you can send it to a dead letter queue.
		DLQ lets u isolate problamatic messages to determine why they are failing.
		When u designate queue to be a source queue, a DLQ is not created automatically.

VPC  --> is requierd to launch or host ec2 instances.
Spin up instance: Spinning up an instance" refers to the process of launching or starting a new virtual machine (VM),
				also known as an instance, in a cloud computing environment like AWS, it refers to launching an EC2 instance.

		We cannot spin up ec2 instance without having a network. Ip address i must.	

CIDR Range (Classless Inter Domain Routing) --> It is number of IP addresses that is required for a network.
	2^32-n -> These many IP addreses can be assigned in Ipv4. (normally used) 256 ip address.
	2^128-n  -> These many IP addreses can be assigned in Ipv6.

Pulic Subnet: Resources residing in public subnet has access over the internet.
	Ip adress range 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127 (128)
	It has both Public and Private IP.
Private Subnet: Resources residing in the private subnet does not have the access over the internet.
	Ip address range 10.0.0.128 - 10.0.0.255
	Used to communicate 
	This does not have public Ip.
IGW -Internet Gateway --> is a scalable, redundant, and highly available component that allows communication between 
	instances in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and the internet. It is essentially a bridge between your private network 
	(VPC) and the public internet.

RT (Routing Table) --> iT IS USED TO CONNECT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTANCES.
	It is connected to IGW.
NAT gateway (Network Address Translation) -> Used in public subnet to spin up instance.

VPC Peering:  A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between 2 VPCs that enables u to route traffic between them using 
			  private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.
			  Instances in either VPCs can communicate with each other as if they are within teh same network.
			  The VPCs can be in different regions.
-------------------------------------------------------------
NACL and Security Groups: 
 MSSQL port --> 1433
 HTTP port --> 80
 HTTPs port --> 443
 SSH -->22
	-A Network Access Control List (NACL) is a stateless firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet
	level. It allows or denies traffic to and from subnets in your VPC.
	-A Security Group is a stateful firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level (i.e., for EC2
	instances, RDS instances, Lambda functions, etc.). 
	
http://composer.com
https://composer
tableau:9015 

What is Statefull Set and Stateless in Security groups aws.
-> A Stateful system is one that remembers the state of network connections and automatically allows return traffic for an allowed request.
  -A Stateless system does not remember the state of network connections. Each request is treated independently, and responses are not automatically allowed.
	
Security Groups considered as Satetfull
Network ACL is considered as stateless.

Vid 9:
Load Balancer --> distributes the load accross the instances or containers or pods or lambda function.
	SG Security groups
	Health Condition

 Types of Load Balancer:
	1. Application load balancer: Mainly used in web applications running http & https protocols.
	2. Network load balancer: Ultra high performance at low latency rate. and can handle millions of requests per second.
	3. Classic Load Balancer: used for applications that were built in existing EC2 classic environment.
	4. gateway load balancer: 
	
Network Load Balancer vs Application Load Balancer:
	Network Load Balancer (NLB):
		-It works by routing the IP packets based on the destination IP address and port, without inspecting the content of the data.
		-NLB handles TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic.
		-Best for low-latency, high-throughput applications.

	Application Load Balancer (ALB):
		-Best for HTTP/HTTPS traffic (web applications).
		-It is ideal for web applications and microservices that require complex routing based on content.
		-It is used to routes HTTP and HTTPS traffic and can inspect the content of the request, such as URL, headers, and query parameters.
		
(Load balancer 24:08)	

SSC (Self Signed Certificate) --> A Self-Signed Certificate (SSC) is an SSL/TLS certificate that is signed by the same 
	entity that created it, rather than a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). In other words, the certificate is not signed 
	by an external, recognized third-party authority but by the organization or individual that owns the domain or service.

What is Target Groups?*
--> In AWS, a Target Group is a logical grouping of resources that you want to route traffic to, typically in the context 
   of load balancing. When using services like Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), the traffic is distributed to the targets 
   (such as EC2 instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions) in a Target Group based on specific rules.

*(AWS Certificate Manager (Inter Q)--> Yes, worked on AWS Certificate.)
--------------------------------------
Auto Scaling --> AWS Auto Scaling is a powerful feature that ensures your application maintains optimal performance and 
			cost efficiency by automatically adjusting the number of EC2 instances in response to changes in demand. 
			It improves availability, reliability, and cost optimization, making it an essential service for dynamic workloads. 

	-Horizontal Scaling ->  It allows organizations to handle large volumes of traffic, ensure high availability, and scale 
						infrastructure elastically as demand increases.  
	-Vertical Scaling -> Vertical scaling (scaling up) is a straightforward approach for handling increased demand by upgrading 
		the hardware of a single instance. It works well for certain workloads like monolithic applications, databases, and 
		legacy systems. However, it has limitations in terms of capacity, fault tolerance, and cost-efficiency as traffic grows. 
	
(1:12:20 scaling)

 What is Launch template and why it is required?*
--> A Launch Template in AWS simplifies and standardizes the process of launching EC2 instances by providing predefined
	configurations. It is required for:
			-Automation and scaling: Especially when used with Auto Scaling groups.
			-Consistency: To ensure that all instances are launched with the same settings.
			-Versioning: To track and maintain different configurations over time.
			-Efficiency: Reduces manual effort and human error when launching EC2 instances

Cloud Management --> Create and Manage Resources with templates.

Cloud Formation --> is a service were we are using the service in order to set up resources.

Template -> template is snippet of code written in YAML or JSON format 
Stack -> Once the template is submitted to cloud formation it creates a stack in order to create the resources.

 What is Cloud Formation stack and write basic cloud fomation template.*
--> A CloudFormation Stack is a collection of AWS resources that you manage as a single unit.When you create a stack, 
		CloudFormation provisions and manages all the resources specified in the template.
	CloudFormation is a powerful tool for automating and managing AWS infrastructure in a consistent, repeatable way using 
	templates. By creating stacks, you can define your entire infrastructure as code and manage its lifecycle (creation, 
	updates, and deletion) with a simple and declarative process.

(IQ - Terraform)

SSO -Single Sign 

ECR: Elastic Container Registry --> 

ECS: Elastic Conatiner Service -->

EKS Elastic Kubernetes Service --> 

------------------------------------------
-Difference btw on premise machines and cloud environment.
--> On-Premise Machines:
		-The hardware and infrastructure are owned and maintained by the organization itself.
		-The organization is responsible for purchasing, setting up, managing, and maintaining
			the physical machines, servers, networking, and storage.
		-Capital Expenditure (CapEx): Initial costs for purchasing hardware, software licenses, and setting up the
			infrastructure.
		-Less flexible, requires manual upgrades
		-Limited to local or VPN access	
	Cloud Environment:
		-The hardware and infrastructure are provided and managed by a third-party cloud service provider 
			(e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud).
		-The organization rents the resources rather than owning them, and the cloud provider manages and maintains
			the physical infrastructure.
		-Operational Expenditure (OpEx): Pay-as-you-go model or subscription-based pricing for resources such as storage, 
				computing power, and networking.
				
		-Access to cutting-edge technologies
		-Accessible globally with internet access

Conclusion:
On-premise is ideal for organizations that need full control over their infrastructure, data, and security, or have specific 
	compliance needs that require local management.
Cloud environments are best for organizations that need flexibility, scalability, cost efficiency, and easier access to
	modern tools and technologies without the burden of infrastructure management.
------------------

What is spin up instance?
-> is a term commonly used in cloud computing to refer to the process of creating or launching a new virtual machine (VM)
	or virtual server (instance) in a cloud environment. When you "spin up" an instance, you are provisioning a new 
	computing resource in the cloud that will run applications, services, or workloads.
	
what is CLi?
-->CLI stands for Command-Line Interface, which is a text-based interface used for interacting with software and operating 
	systems. Instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and icons, a CLI allows users to type commands 
	to perform specific tasks.
	
What is regions and AZs.
--> A Region is a geographic area that contains one or more Availability Zones.
An Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically separate data center or group of data centers within a specific region. 

What is default retention period?
--> The default retention period refers to the length of time that data, logs, backups, or other resources are
	stored before they are automatically deleted, archived, or no longer accessible by the system.  
Default 4 days and retention period ranges from 60sec to max 14 days.

what is maximum size.

Explain SQS?
--> SQS is a simple queue service in which we can use this particular queues in order to where we have something called as a producer and a consumer.
which will be continously generating messages and the consumer will be consuming those messages, in btw those producer and consumers we can 
create a queue.

Explain project architecture?
there was a microservice which was continously generating some packets of data, so those data that needs to be consumed by the
other microservice applications. In order to do that we have craeted a queue called the test queue.
This is used by the developers in order to push the messages in to the queue and similarly the message will be consumed out of the 
particular queue.

What is max size payload in a queue?
--> Maximum Payload Size: The maximum size of a message in SQS is 256 KB.
	This includes both the message body and any metadata.
	If your message exceeds 256 KB, you would need to split the message or use alternative solutions like Amazon S3 to
		store the payload and include a reference to it in the SQS message.
A message can be sent with max paylaod of 2gb that with java card library.

What is dead letter queue?

What is SSE and CSE?

what is s3 bucket?
--> An S3 bucket refers to a storage container in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), a highly scalable and 
		durable object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
	S3 is used to store and manage any amount of data, such as files, backups, logs, images, videos, and more. 
	S3 buckets are the basic containers used for organizing and storing objects (data files) within the service.

What is edge location?
--> An Edge Location is a part of AWS's content delivery network, CloudFront, and is used to cache content closer 
	to end users around the world. These locations help reduce latency, improve website and content delivery speeds, 
	and enhance the overall user experience by serving data from nearby geographic locations.

----------------------
3-Tier Architecture in AWS
--> A 3-tier architecture is a software design pattern that divides the application into three logical layers or "tiers" — typically, 
	the presentation layer, the logic layer, and the data layer. 	
	
	1. Presentation Layer (Frontend):
		This is the user interface and is responsible for providing users with access to the application.
		It could be a web or mobile application that interacts with the backend systems via APIs or HTTP requests.
	2. Logic Layer (Application Layer):
		This layer contains the business logic and the backend application logic that handles requests from the presentation layer, processes them, and communicates with the data layer.
		It could be a RESTful API, microservices, or serverless functions.
	3. Data Layer (Database Layer):
		This layer contains the data storage and is responsible for persistent storage of the application data.
		It handles tasks like querying, storing, and managing databases and other data stores.

what is Disaster recovery mechanism in aws?
--> Disaster Recovery (DR) in AWS refers to the strategies, processes, and tools used to recover from catastrophic events, such as hardware failures, network outages, or other disruptions.

key disaster recovery mechanisms are:
	1. AWS Regions and Availability Zones (AZs)
	2. Backup and Restore (Simple and Effective)
	3. Pilot Light Disaster Recovery
	4. Warm Standby Disaster Recovery
	5. Multi-Region and Multi-AZ Architecture
	6. Backup and Restore Strategy with Amazon Glacier
	7. Cross-Region Replication and Cross-Region Failover
	8. AWS Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling
	9. Amazon Route 53 for DNS Failover
	10. CloudEndure Disaster Recovery
	11. Amazon CloudWatch for Monitoring
	12. AWS Elastic File System (EFS) for Data Recovery

Lambda vs Elastic Beanstalk.
-> EBS:
	 A Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies the deployment and management of web applications and services on AWS. 
	  Ideal for deploying full-fledged web applications, services, and APIs. 
	  Provides a degree of control over the environment, allowing you to configure and customize the stack using configuration files. 
	  Supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks. 
Lambda: A serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
	Suitable for event-driven functions, microservices, and APIs. 
	You pay only for the compute time your functions use, and there's a free tier. 
	Processing images in S3, sending notifications based on events, or building APIs.

what is s3 bucket versioning
-> a feature that allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket, enabling data recovery and 
compliance by preserving, retrieving, and restoring every version of every object stored in your S3 bucket.
